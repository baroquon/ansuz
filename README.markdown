Ansuz is an open source Content Management System built in Ruby on Rails.
It aims for a modular / plugin-based design, and should have more features
out of the box than any other Rails CMS weâ€™re aware of.
 
By combining the CMSes of Isshen Solutions and Isotope 11, we plan to create
a best-of-breed technology suitable for production use on a myriad of sites.
Ansuz is licensed via the BSD license.

NOTE: See the Ansuz Site Laucher
If run with sudo on a server with passenger set up and all the gems already installed, 
it will check out a new ansuz and set up a fresh database for it and set up a vhost 
for the domain specified. So, then if that domain points to the server, Bam! Done.
